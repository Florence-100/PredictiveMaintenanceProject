# PredictiveMaintenanceProject

Hi this is a repository of the codes I used for developing predictive maintenance models for my capstone project. 

I worked on anomaly detection, machine state classification and remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction. The datasets I used are the Microsoft Azure Predictive Maintenance dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/arnabbiswas1/microsoft-azure-predictive-maintenance), the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset, CMAPSS (https://www.kaggle.com/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps) and machine sensor readings generated with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). I am currently working on RUL prediction for the GMM dataset.
