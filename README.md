# PredictiveMaintenanceProject

Hi this is a repository of the codes I used for developing predictive maintenance models for my capstone project. 

I worked on predictive maintenance through identifying anomalous sensor readings, estimating machine remaining useful lifetime (RUL) and utilising machine learning and statistical methods to recommend maintenance actions. The different models used for anomaly detection and RUL prediction are stored in their respective files. The performance of the anomaly detection and RUL prediction models in prolonging machine life through intelligent maintenance recommendations are stored in the Results file. 

The models are deployed on the Integrated Testbed to give maintenance actions to a factory system simulated in real-time. The models are deployed on Jetson Nano and the code can be found in the Demo Code file.
